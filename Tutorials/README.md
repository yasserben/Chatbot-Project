# DeepPavlov Tutorials

This folder contains some of the tutorials I took when I started the project.

THese tutorials helped me undestand some of the NLP concepts, which allowed me to
progress a little more in the project and start working using the framework.

It is important to note that by the time I took the tutorials, some were already outdated since version 0.3.0.
DeepPavlov framework was only in its infancy and was undergoing a lot of changes,
so you may encounter some errors while running these tutorials I've had too.
