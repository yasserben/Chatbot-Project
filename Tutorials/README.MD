#DeepPavlov Tutorials

This folder contains some of the tutorials I took when I started the project.
I understood some of NLP concepts through these tutorials, which allowed me to
progress a little more in the project and start working with the framework.

It is important to note that by the time I took the tutorials, some were already outdated since version 0.3.0,
since the DeepPavlov framework was only in its infancy and was undergoing a lot of changes,
so you may encounter some errors while running these tutorials I've had too.
