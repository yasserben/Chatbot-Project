# DeepPavlov Project
This repository is intended to present my semester project that I made in [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/en) with the [Data Science Departement](http://www.eurecom.fr/ds/) and which focuses on the implementation of a chatbot using the DeepPavlov framework

## Objectives of the Project

The main objective of the project is to be able to create a Deep Learning-based chatbot
specialized for tourism in order to communicate with him and exchange information related
to this topic.
The project could be divided into three main stages:

1. Getting started with the framework and the development environment.
2. Understanding and use of the different tutorials available about the DeepPavlov frame-
work.
3. Application of the concept seen previously on our own database.

### Methodology

Throughout this project, we used the official [Github repistory](https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov) of the framework as well as itâ€™s documentation.
We also asked some questions in the forum which is still in its infancy, and therefore the
community behind it is still growing and expanding as well.
the scientific articles and videos allowed us to discover and understand the functioning of
several new technical concepts which later were very useful for us to understand in details
the functioning of chatbots.
We shared all of our files we worked on throughout the project on this repository.
